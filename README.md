# -Sonar-Data-Set-Classification-for-Underwater-Object-Detection
Problem Statement:
The objective of this study is to develop an accurate and robust machine learning model that can classify underwater objects as rocks or mines based on Sonar data. The Sonar data set comprises acoustic signals generated by Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) technology, which are collected from an underwater environment. The dataset consists of various features extracted from these signals, making it suitable for the application of machine learning techniques.

The challenge lies in accurately discriminating between rocks and mines in the Sonar data set, which is crucial for enhancing the safety and efficiency of underwater operations. Traditional signal processing methods like Fourier transform and wavelet transform have limitations in handling the complexities of underwater acoustic signals. Hence, the application of machine learning algorithms becomes essential to efficiently process the data and predict the target objects.

The problem entails three main tasks: first, preprocessing and preparing the Sonar data set to ensure its quality and consistency; second, selecting appropriate features and engineering them for optimal performance in the classification task; and finally, training and evaluating a range of machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for underwater object detection.

The successful development of an accurate Sonar data set classifier would have significant implications for underwater exploration, maritime security, and environmental monitoring. Moreover, it would open avenues for further research in improving underwater object detection methods and signal processing techniques, leading to advancements in underwater technology and operations.
